This is what Julius Won and Rocky Shao have been doing is the past days of build.
Wrote code to detect gamepieces, but only tells center of the gamepiece on webcam frame, still need angle and distance to gamepieces.
Problem: Got RGB-D camera(tells distance to gamepiece), need python 3.7 to install the library for it, current version is 3.11

In order to counter problem:
    1.Julius reseted his computer and reinstalled python 3.7, a way to solve the problem.
    2.Rocky built a virtual environment that runs python 3.7 to solve problem 2.
        The command lines Rocky used:
            virtualenv Camera_env --python=python3.7
            Camera_env\Scripts\activate.bat
            pip install pipenv
            pip install pyrealsense2---->this is the library for the RGB-D camera, and it successfully intsalled it in my virtual environment called Camera_env
            pip install opencv-python
        Aware: Adam Newhouse told us to use pipenv->pipenv --python3.7, but Rocky didn't use it at all.->BIG PROBLEM.
    
Next step:
    Learn library for the RGB-D camera to get accurate distance to gamepieces.
    Learn how virtual environment works and how will it coperate with the computer that will be on the final robot.
    Use pipenv
    If we hit a wall through virtual environment, we might have to build the library from source.
    Copy code from last year to tell angle to gamepieces.
