This is what Julius Won and Rocky Shao have been doing is the past days of build.

Wrote code to detect gamepieces,tells center of the gamepiece and accurate distance from the center of the gamepiece to the camera.
Still need angle and distance to gamepieces.
In order to install library for camera:
        Use command lines:
        
        
            virtualenv Camera_env --python=python3.7
            Camera_env\Scripts\activate.bat
            pip install pipenv
            pip install pyrealsense2          //this is the library for the RGB-D camera, and it successfully intsalled it in my virtual environment called Camera_env
            pip install opencv-python
            
            
        Aware: Adam Newhouse told us to use pipenv->pipenv --python3.7, but didn't use it at all.->MIGHT BE PROBLEM?.
    
Next step:
    Learn how virtual environment works and how will it coperate with the computer that will be on the final robot.
    Use pipenv?
    If we hit a wall through virtual environment, we might have to build the library from source.
    Copy code from last year to tell angle to gamepieces.
    Considering to use machine learning to detect gamepieces in a quiker and more reliable way then HSV filter
