1.Wrote code to detect gamepieces, but only tells center of the gamepiece
2.Got RGB-D camera, need python 3.7 to install the library for it, current version is 3.11
3.Built a  virtual environment that runs python 3.7 to solve problem 2.
    The command lines I used:
        virtualenv Camera_env --python=python3.7
        Camera_env\Scripts\activate.bat
        pip install pipenv
        pip install pyrealsense2
        pip install opencv-python
    Aware: Adam Newhouse told me to use pipenv->pipenv --python3.7, but I didn't use it at all.->BIG PROBLEM.
4.Next step:
    Learn library for the RGB-D camera
    Learn how virtual environment works
